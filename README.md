# TotallyNotCorrent
Google drive based decentralized file sharing?

This project was created SOLELY for educational purposes (seriously, I'm not saying this to only get out of legal trouble - I wanted to make a web app). I am not responsible for what you do with it. Yes, the site was 'inspired' by a site used for film piracy, but that isn't what you should use it for.

I am very unlikely to update this, and it was just a project to practice building PHP applications that can be used by others. It should be simple enough to install if you do want to use it, however I cannot guarantee the stability of the application, nor the security. If you do decide to use it, and create a public project, it would be much appreciated for me to be credited.
